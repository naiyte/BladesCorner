Customer:  Rene' Wilmoth
Website Name:  Blade's Corner (Devotion & Scripture Commentary)

Introduction:

I have learnt that sometimes God leaves parts of us broken...on purpose...
maybe to keep us humble...I see my faults, insecurities, and fears floating
to the surface like oil on water...and I remind myself that I know God and
often wonder how these parts still remain so broken...and I do not have the 
answers...but these days I have found so much solace in the Word of God and 
also increasingly in praise and worship...I feel my fears and discomforts
melting away in the Presence of God and often I walk away with the broken
parts intact it seem...but yet another part of me feels strong and healed
at the same time...#brokentobeblessedIguess...Jesus is able to love us
past our pain!
